# ngx-http-crypt (Angular 4+)

This module is the counterpart to [express-crypto](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-crypto) and designed to transmit a encrypted content to a REST API. As encryption is used the `AES Standard`.

It is simply passed through the `@angular/http` module only that this module will encrypt and decrypt the transmitted content.

## Installation

```
npm i --save-exact ngx-http-crypt
```

## Configure your Angular Application

#### Set the `CryptHttpService` as provider in your AppModule:

```
import { CryptHttpService } from 'ngx-http-crypt';

@NgModule({
  providers: [
    .
    .
    .
    CryptHttpService
  ]
})

```

#### Call the function to configure your settings in your app component

```
import { CryptHttpService } from 'ngx-http-crypt';
import { Component, ViewEncapsulation, Inject } from '@angular/core';


@Component({
  selector: 'demo', // <my-app></my-app>
  templateUrl: './app.component.pug',
  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None,
  styleUrls: [ ],
  providers: [ ]
})
export class AppComponent {

  constructor(public crypt: CryptHttpService) {
  }

  ngOnInit() {
    this.crypt.configure({
        secret: 'secret123!',
        cryptInactive: true|false
      })
  }
}
```

##### configure(object)

- secret: Define your own secret for the AES encryption
- cryptInactive: Set it to true when you like to disable the encryption. Default is false
- warnInactive: Set it to true when you like to disable the warn message on transfer of a not encrypted content.

### Make your first Call with encryption

The usage of this module is the same as the `@angular/http` module. You will find the docs [here](https://angular.io/api/http/Http)


Example:

```
import { CryptHttpService } from 'ngx-http-crypt';
import { Component, ViewEncapsulation, Inject } from '@angular/core';


@Component({
  .
  .
  .
})
export class IamAComponent {

  constructor(public crypt: CryptHttpService) {
  }

  send() {
    this.crypt.post(url: string, options?: RequestOptionArgs).subscribe(res => res)
  }
}

```

### Subscribe module activity

With this method it's possible to subscribe activity for ex a loadingbar.

Example:
```
import { CryptHttpService } from 'ngx-http-crypt';
import { Component, ViewEncapsulation, Inject } from '@angular/core';


@Component({
  .
  .
  .
})
export class IamAComponent {

  constructor(public crypt: CryptHttpService) {
    this.crypt.onLoad().subscribe(d => {
      d => true when a request is running, false when it's done
    });
  }

  send() {
    this.crypt.post(url: string, options?: RequestOptionArgs).subscribe(res => res)
  }
}

```
